# Cyclist Case Study

## The Question : How do annual memmbers and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Ask
### Scenario: 
I want to help the Marketing Director (Moreno), understand how the two usertypes use our bikes differently to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members to support future growth. We are looking at historical bike trip data to identify differences.

### Prepare
### Data
We are using historical data on bike trips tracked from 2019_q2 through 2020_q1. 
* Check data for organization, integrity, credability and other problems. 
* Save your data in a safe location. 
* Can this data help you answer the question?

### Process
### Cleaning the Data
* Make copies of the data and create subfolders to store data. 
* Choose tool to process the data. 
* Delete identifying data
* The data from 2020_q1 is formated different than all the 2019 data. Make columns consistent and and combine data. 
* Create additional rows to help you better understand the data. 
* There are some BAD data from 2019 that shows negative times for ride lengths.(Get feedback from Marketing Director, Moreno, on dealing with this data) 

### Analyze
### Using R
* Load and import data
* Load and download R packages needed for analysis. 
* Clean up data to prepare for analysis (make colums consistent and merge the data sets into one single dataframe)
* Create summary statistics / discriptive analysis.

### Share
### Create a visualization 
* Determine the best way to share your findings (PowerPoint, Excel, Tableau, R) 
* Are we able to answer the question?
* What story does the data tell?
* Who is your audience?
* Does the visualization support your key findings?

### Act
* What are your conclusions
* Next Steps
* Recommendations 
* Additional Analysis needed?
